# ChitChat

* This version of ChitChat is configurable with a `config.json` file
* This version is able to log to a `chitchat.log` file
* There are test files in this code
* All structs are fully fleshed out (in the book chapter, they are only implied)
* Some of the functions are placed as methods for the struct types instead of being a part of the package
